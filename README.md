# Baseball Trip Planner
This assignment was the culminating project for our C++ course. The project implements the use of:
  - Reading and Writing to Files
  - Classes, constructors, destructors, pointers 
  - Proper Code Documentation
  - Data Structures &#38; Algorithms

Important Notes:
  - The project was not fully implemented and was graded as a "how much can you get done" type of project.
  - The project required the use of QT Creator widgets and thus the project will not run unless you have QT Creator and its Widgets installed.
